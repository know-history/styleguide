# Know History Style Guides

Every company has its own style guide: a set of conventions or guidelines about how to write code for that company. It is much easier to understand code when all the code in it is in a consistent style.

“Style” covers a lot of ground, from “use camelCase for variable names” to “never use global variables” to “never use exceptions.” This project ([know-history/styleguide](https://github.com/know-history/styleguide/tree/gh-pages)) links to the style guidelines we use for Know History code. If you are modifying a project that originated at Know History, you may be pointed to this page to see the style guides that apply to that project.

This project holds the [C# Style Guide][csharp], [SQL Server Style Guide][sqlserver], and [Vue.js Style Guide][vue].
